## Deployment
<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
### How to deploy locally

To deploy locally, users must create an account at https://chatengine.io/ and create a project to obtain their own secret / project ID for launch.

1. `npm install`
2. create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project and copy the below formatting:
`NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID=<INSERT YOUR UNIQUE PROJECT ID FROM CHATENGINE.IO HERE>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHATENG_SECRET=<INSERT YOUR UNIQUE PRIVATE KEY FROM CHATENGINE.IO HERE>`
3. For Windows: `npm run win` For Mac/Linux: `npm run dev`

### How to deploy via Docker

For Docker deployment, users will still need to create a project in https://chatengine.io/ to obtain unique project IDs and private keys. 
1. `docker build . -t my-image-name-here`
2. Navigate to your Docker images and press "run" Open the drop down menu in "optional settings" and input the port `3000`
3. In the same "optional settings" window, input two different variables: `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID` with the value of your project ID from chatengine & `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHATENG_SECRET` with the unique private key from chatengine. 


## Inspiration 

For our deployment module project, our group wanted to focus on deployment and creating a docker image for our project. Our project is a fast and functional messenger application that can be deployed on docker and is hosted via AWS.

## What It Does

The Multiverse Messenger web application allows users to create an account and log in, send messages, create groups, add/remove users from groups, and delete groups. The messages are instant, and the website has functioning authentication to ensure privacy of user messages.

## What's Next 

If our group were to continue development on Multiverse Messenger, a goal of ours would be capabilities to edit and delete specific messages, or maybe even integration of giphy.
